Making British Parliamentary debate education easy and free.

# Fine-tuning project for the llama LLM
<p>The goal of the project is to train the llama 3.1 model to write quality British Parliamentary debate motions, arguments for either side of a motion, and infoslides for motions.</p>

# Process
<ol>
  <li>Gather data from scraping public APIs</li>
  <li>Clean and reformat the data into a more usable form</li>
  <li>Convert the data into a pseudo-ranomized Instructional Dataset which can be used for training</li>
  <li>Use Unsloth and the QLoRa method to train the llama 3.1 model on the instructional dataset</li>
</ol>

# Where can you access the model and dataset?
